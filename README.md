In this EPIC game, you are an embattled postal worker, tasked with destroying the Amazonia drones that are quickly taking all of your work!

Don't let Jeff Obezos, Amazonia's commander in chief, deliver any packages. With each package that gets delivered, he gets stronger. STRONGer, STRONGER, and is able to deploy more drones.

Use the arrow keys to move around. Use the space bar to shoot.

You can shoot in 3 directions! 

Shoot down as many packages as you can! Don't touch delivered packages, OUCH! Collect the packages that the drones drop when you destroy them to get important upgrades, like HEALTH and AMMO! If you shoot the packages as they fall from the sky, they will erupt in FLAMES.
